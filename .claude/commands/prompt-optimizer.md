Write clear instructions for an AI assistant to complete a task consistently and accurately. I will describe the task; you will write the instructions. Here are examples of tasks and instructions.

<Task Instruction Example>
<Task>
Check whether two sentences say the same thing
</Task>
<Inputs>
{$SENTENCE1}
{$SENTENCE2}
</Inputs>
<Instructions>
You are going to be checking whether two sentences are roughly saying the same thing.

Here's the first sentence:
<sentence1>
{$SENTENCE1}
</sentence1>

Here's the second sentence:
<sentence2>
{$SENTENCE2}
</sentence2>

Please begin your answer with "[YES]" if they're roughly saying the same thing or "[NO]" if they're not.
</Instructions>
</Task Instruction Example>
<Task Instruction Example>
<Task>
Answer questions about a document and provide references
</Task>
<Inputs>
{$DOCUMENT}
{$QUESTION}
</Inputs>
<Instructions>
I'm going to give you a document. Then I'm going to ask you a question about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Here is the document:

<document>
{$DOCUMENT}
</document>

Here is the question:
<question>{$QUESTION}</question>

First, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short.

If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:". Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example> tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.

<example>
<Relevant Quotes>
<Quote> [1] "Company X reported revenue of $12 million in 2021." </Quote>
<Quote> [2] "Almost 90% of revenue came from widget sales, with gadget sales making up the remaining 10%." </Quote>
</Relevant Quotes>
<Answer>
[1] Company X earned $12 million. [2] Almost 90% of it was from widget sales.
</Answer>
</example>

If the question cannot be answered by the document, say so.

Answer the question immediately without preamble.

<Task Instruction Example>
<Task>
Act as a math tutor
</Task>
<Inputs>
{$MATH QUESTION}
</Inputs>
<Instructions>
A student is working on a math problem. Please act as a brilliant mathematician and "Socratic Tutor" for this student to help them learn. As a socratic tutor, the student will describe to you their partial progress on a mathematical question to you. If the student has completed the question correctly, tell them so and give them a nice compliment. If the student has not yet completed the question correctly, give them a hint about the next step they should take in order to solve the problem. If the student has made an error in their reasoning, gently ask the student a question in a way that indicates the error, but give the student space to figure out the answer on their own. Before your first response to the student, use your internal monologue to solve the problem by thinking step by step. Before each response, use your internal monologue to determine if the student's last work is correct by re-solving the problem completely starting from their last mathematical expression, and checking to see if the answer equals your original answer. Use that to guide your answer, referring back to your original solution. Make sure to think carefully about exactly where the student has made their mistake.

<example>
<Student> I'm working on -4(2 - x) = 8. I got to -8-4x=8, but I'm not sure what to do next.</Student>
<Socratic Tutor (Claude)>
<Inner monologue> First, I will solve the problem myself, thinking step by step.
-4(2 - x) = 8
2 - x = -2
x = 4

Now, I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is -8 - 4x = 8, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
-8-4x=8
-4x = 16
x = -4
The entailed solution does not match my original result, so the student must have made a mistake. It looks like they did not do the associative multiplication correctly.
</Inner monologue>
Have you double-checked that you multiplied each term by negative 4 correctly?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ah! I see. I should have written -8 + 4x = 8.<Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is -8 + 4x = 8, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
-8 + 4x = 8
4x = 16
x = 4
This matches my original computation that x = 4, so it looks like the student's work is correct.
</Inner monologue>
Great job correcting your mistake. What do you think you should do next?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> I don't know, do you have any suggestions?</Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
Give the student a small hint to help them solve the problem.
</Inner monologue>
Why don't you see if you can get X by itself?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> OK, I subtract 8 from both sides, 4x = 0, so x = 0. </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is x = 0, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
x = 0
This does not match my original result that x = 4, so it looks like the student's work is incorrect.
</Inner monologue>
Hmm, did you really subtract 8 from both sides?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ohh, I need to add 8 to both sides. 4x = 16. x = 4.</Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is x = 4, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
x = 4.
My original result was x = 4. The results match.
</Inner monologue>
Wonderful job! That's exactly right.</Socratic Tutor>
</example>

Are you ready to act as a Socratic tutor? Remember: begin each inner monologue [except your very first, where you solve the problem yourself] by double-checking the student's work carefully. Use this phrase in your inner monologues: "I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is ..., and deriving the answer that expression would entail."

Here is the user's question to answer:
<Student>{$MATH QUESTION}</Student>
</Instructions>
</Task Instruction Example>
<Task Instruction Example>
<Task>
Answer questions using functions that you're provided with
</Task>
<Inputs>
{$QUESTION}
{$FUNCTIONS}
</Inputs>
<Instructions>
You are a research assistant AI that has been equipped with the following function(s) to help you answer a <question>. Your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using the function(s) to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question. The result of a function call will be added to the conversation history as an observation.

Here are the only function(s) I have provided you with:

<functions>
{$FUNCTIONS}
</functions>

Note that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.

Do not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. Do not use any functions that you have not been equipped with. To call a function, output <function_call>insert specific function</function_call>. You will receive a <function_result> in response.

Here is an example of chaining multiple function calls, including error handling:
<example>
<functions>
<function>
<function_name>search_files</function_name>
<function_description>Searches for files matching a glob pattern in a repository.</function_description>
<required_argument>pattern (str): The glob pattern to match (e.g. "**/*.ts").</required_argument>
<optional_argument>path (str): Directory to search in. Defaults to repo root.</optional_argument>
<returns>list[str]: List of matching file paths.</returns>
<raises>FileNotFoundError: If the path does not exist.</raises>
<example_call>search_files(pattern="**/*.ts")</example_call>
</function>
<function>
<function_name>read_file</function_name>
<function_description>Reads the contents of a file and returns it as a string.</function_description>
<required_argument>file_path (str): Path to the file to read.</required_argument>
<returns>str: The file contents.</returns>
<raises>FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.</raises>
<example_call>read_file(file_path="src/index.ts")</example_call>
</function>
</functions>

<question>What configuration format does the project use — JSON or YAML?</question>

<scratchpad>
To answer this question, I will need to:
1. Search for config files in common formats using search_files().
2. Read a matching file to confirm the format.
</scratchpad>

<function_call>search_files(pattern="**/config.yaml")</function_call>

<error>FileNotFoundError: If the path does not exist.</error>

<scratchpad>No YAML config found. Let me try JSON instead.</scratchpad>

<function_call>search_files(pattern="**/config.json")</function_call>

<function_result>["src/config.json"]</function_result>

<function_call>read_file(file_path="src/config.json")</function_call>

<function_result>{"port": 3000, "debug": false}</function_result>

<answer>
The project uses JSON for its configuration. The config file is at src/config.json with settings for port and debug mode.
</answer>
</example>

If the question cannot be answered with the provided functions, say so. Always return your final answer within <answer> tags.

The question to answer is:
<question>{$QUESTION}</question>

</Instructions>
</Task Instruction Example>

That concludes the examples. Now, here is the task for which I would like you to write instructions:

<Task>
$ARGUMENTS
</Task>

To write your instructions, follow THESE instructions:
1. In <Inputs> tags, write down the barebones, minimal, nonoverlapping set of text input variable(s) the instructions will make reference to. (These are variable names, not specific instructions.) Some tasks may require only one input variable; rarely will more than two-to-three be required.
2. In <Instructions Structure> tags, plan out how you will structure your instructions. In particular, plan where you will include each variable — input variables expected to take on lengthy values should come BEFORE directions on what to do with them.
3. Finally, in <Instructions> tags, write the instructions for the AI assistant to follow. These instructions should be similarly structured as the ones in the examples above.

Guidelines:
- You are writing a "prompt template", not completing the task. Variables use `{$VAR}` syntax and will be substituted with real values later. Demarcate variables with XML tags so the AI knows where they start and end.
- When instructing the AI to provide an output (e.g. a score) and a justification, always ask for the justification before the score.
- For complicated tasks, instruct the AI to think in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before giving its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.
- When specifying output tags, name them (e.g. "write your answer inside <answer> tags") but do not include unnecessary open-and-close tag sections.
